Our privacy policy is this : “Back away, fast, from our data, assholes.”
 
I mean there's all kindsa details about cookies, ip addresses all sorta techno bullshit usually covered in these "policies."
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 
Privacy is the right to feel safe and good instead of guarded and fearful and on alert while you pursue happiness and exercise liberty. And no one you don't wanna know, oughta know how you, why, if, when and with whome do that. Or anything.
 
We're with you. Not only do we do routinely do stuff that is actually quite shameful, or at least meant to be secret, but we also do stuff that is actually quite good but that could be made to look bad or shameful. Info about us could be used to harm us, or you, or, say, even just divert our flow of bliss, or amp our agonies, even if just for a moment. 
 
SO: It is our intention never to tell anybody anything about you.  Like a library is supposed to be.
 
BUT:
 
If the govs, the bad guys, or whoever somehow trumps our intention, and they get at the information you have entrusted to us, then they beat us. They just beat us. They must have some combination of being smarter and/or uglier and/or investing more and/or caring more and/or being more violent. Whatever.
 
But this will piss us off. 
 
We will learn from the defeated intentions, and fight back, until we can't.
 
Freedom and Safety are what we want for ourselves and for you, why we’re working on this at all. Freedom as in the blood-soaked fields the world over that have yielded us the fruit of this priceless opportunity to permanently extend and more deeply entrench freedom and safety in the world. 
 
And we won’t let the assholes in if there is anything we can effectively do about it.
 
Or it may be that you have some heavy peeps on your ass. We will still be pissed off, and keep trying new things to help you out.
 
And if there is a particular threat against you, we will give you the opportunity to help us fight for your freedom and safety. And if you don't wanna fight back, that's fine. Then we won't, either.  But, ya know, even then, we do reserve the right to fight on your behalf, because, as we said, we will be pissed off.
 
Love,
Your Apps for your Head Team
 
 
PS: if you say we can, we will write you. Maybe. Tell us to stop, we will. The people who publish the App or whatever you purchased here will have your info, too.  If they suck, please let us know, and we will dig in a bit. Umm. Is there more? Lots and lots, probably. We expect everything to excite over the next few years. There will be lots of action on this front.  When we encounter something relevant, usually by making a mistake, we will fix it by thinking and deciding and then using words here.
